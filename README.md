# Notes Manager

Phases 1 and 2 complete, plus login with the help of Spring Security.

You must download the repository and in the root folder run the following command:

```
docker-compose -p notes-manager up
```

Docker version

```
Docker: 23.0.5
```

This will deploy a container that will connect to a cloud database that has the users loaded.

Users to access the application

```
User: dannyj182
Password: D@nny!23

User: daniela1993
Password: D@niela!23
```

I tried to deploy the application in the cloud but it was not possible to log me in because of some problem with the provider or some configuration was missing that allows to log in.

You can access through this [Link](notes-manager.up.railway.app).

I hope you like the solution.
